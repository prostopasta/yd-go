# YD.go
## Go experimental wrap for Yandex-disk CLI daemon (linux)

It's just my experiments with golang programming technologies. So, don't blame me for strange solutions in the code.

I've made it as it is rather well-known task for me (I've made the same wrap-up in YD-tools project in Python language).

At the moment GUI for go-wrapper is organaized in modified yandex-disk-indicator.py code from https://github.com/slytomcat/yandex-disk-indicator
Python code responsible for all GUI staff ans uses go-wrapper instead of original yandex-disk utility.
