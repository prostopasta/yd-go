# YD.go
## Go experimental wrap for Yandex-disk CLI daemon (linux)

It's just my experiments with golang programming technologies.

I've made it as it is rather well-known task for me (I've made the same wrap-up in YD-tools project in Python language).

At the moment GUI for go-wrapper show current status in system tray by differnt icons and it has menu that shows current status, disk properties (Used/Total/Free/Trash) and allow to start and stop daemon.
