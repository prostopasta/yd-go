# YD.go
## Go experimental wrap for Yandex-disk CLI daemon (linux)

It's just my experiments with golang programming technologies. So, don't blame me for strange solutions in the code.

I've made it as it is rather well-known task for me (I've made the same wrap-up in YD-tools project in Python language).

There is still open question - how to show tracked status changes to user. The current program just output it into log.
